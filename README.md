## Hello, World! 🧛

My name is Alexey and I am a 1st year student at the National Research University Higher School of Economics of the Applied Mathematics and Computer Science educational program. I am incredibly proud of this, because my journey has been very long but interesting. 

I study algorithms and data structures at university. In the first semester, the algorithms were in Python, but now the time has started with C++ 😈😈😈😈

I really want to work as an ML engineer in the future. I will be programming somewhere in the snowy mountains and skiing 😁

Nice to meet you! 🌻
